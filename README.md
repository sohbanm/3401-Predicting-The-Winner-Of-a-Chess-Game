# 3401-Predicting-The-Winner-Of-a-Chess-Game
Introduction
Chess is a timeless game that can be played from anywhere, whether online or on your phone. For this project, we analyzed a dataset available on Kaggle, which gave us opportunities to gain insights from the data. Our objective was to develop a predictive model using historical data and showcase a path to success to future chess players. This report outlines our machine-learning algorithm that predicts game outcomes. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), prepared the data for modeling, trained, and evaluated various machine learning models, and presented the analysis results.
